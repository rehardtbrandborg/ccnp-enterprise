## Cisco SD-Access sandbox

You must provision a sandbox environment to follow along with the SD-WAN lab. A Cisco DevNet account and the AnyConnect VPN client are required.

1. Click [Cisco SD-WAN Reservation](https://devnetsandbox.cisco.com/RM/Diagram/Index/c9679e49-6751-4f43-9bb4-9d7ee162b069?diagramType=Topology) which should take you to Cisco DevNet. If the link doesn't work, go to <https://developer.cisco.com/search/sd-wan/> and look for *Cisco SD-WAN Reservation*.

2. Log in when prompted

3. Click the *Reserve* button to provision the sandbox. Follow the on-screen instructions.

Once the sandbox is provisioned and you're connected to the VPN, browse to the vManage NMS address <https://10.10.20.90:443>
